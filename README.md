# csharp

Q. What is csharp?  
A. It's my completely original (sarcasm) name for a lottery guessing game using c# and .net...

Q. What does csharp do?
A. csharp can do three things: (1) it can export a list of all Mega Millions drawings since 2002; (2) it can export a subset of drawings data from a specific date forward; (3) you can pick 5 numbers between 1 and 70 and 1 number between 1 and 55 to see if your numbers have ever won the Mega Millions jackpot
